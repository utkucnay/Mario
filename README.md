# Game Programming and Mario From Scratch

My first goal is show my abilities for companies. I've been working 2 years on game programming. I am studying myself for a T programmer. I think, engine programmers are should T type programmer because you built for codebase to everyone in company. Firstly I explained technology after that, I will tell where I used in Mario game.
